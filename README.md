nodeChat
========
Basic Chat application, just for learning socket.io has no functionality we can chat, there is no rule in number of users, but will be ideal for 2 people because it doesn't display the name of sender of incoming message. And has no support of emoticon as well and has no validation of the text, so beware of XSS
